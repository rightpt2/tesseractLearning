Who We Are and What We Do
Our Job Is
Our Job Is Not
Analytic Mission
Our job as intelligence officers is to:
Define intelligence problems and issues clearly.
Anticipate trends and developments.
Provide our consuiners with judgments and insights.
Tell our consumers what is realiy happening in 2 situation.
Be responsive to our consumers.
Evaluate raw information critically to determine its relevance,
reliability, and weight as evidence.
Extract key points from raw information or otherwise identify what
is important in a sea of detail.
Make meaningful characterizations about data by “synthesizing” e
them into judgments that are greater than the data they’re based on.
Deal with ambiguity, uncover and test assumptions, reconcile
conflicting information, and guard against bias, subjectivity,
deception, and “politicization.”
Consider the views of others.
Evaluate alternative scenarios.
Assess implications for our consumers.
It is not our job to know everything.
We have to make judgments on the basis of information that is
incomplete, conflicting, and of varying degrees of reliability.
We need to provide the best possible answer given the time and
information available.
We do not pile up detail. Data dumps are not the way to show ou
expertise.
And we are not historians.
As intelligence analysts, we “synthesize”:
We interpret, not describe.
We render the complex simple,
We read, weigh, and assess fragmentary information to determine
what it means, to get the “big picture.”
That is, we draw conclusions that are greater than the data they’re
based on, One plus one equals three!
